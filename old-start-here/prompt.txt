Help me build a real-time facial expression recognition application using Python, DeepFace, and OpenCV.

Requirements:
Use webcam to detect facial expressions in real-time.
Display webcam feed and matching character image side-by-side.
Detect these expressions: happy, sad, neutral.
Update the displayed image when expression changes.
Press 'q' to quit the application.

Project Setup:
I have an "images" folder with character images for each expression.
I have an "expressions.json" file that maps expressions to image filenames – format: {"happy": ["happy.png"], "sad": ["sad.png"], "neutral": ["neutral.png"]} – default to the "neutral" image when an unknown expression is found.
Create a requirements.txt with all dependencies.
Add a README with installation and usage instructions.

Technical Details:
Use DeepFace for emotion detection.
Only analyze every 10 frames for better performance.
Cache loaded images to avoid re-reading from disk.
Make the UI visually appealing with a clean layout.
Display the current expression name on screen.
Keep the code simple and well-organized in a single file.
Run the app when you are done.
